2.  Alex figured out that the shift_strobe is the enable to the Flex_9_Counter and figured out the RX_Data buffer was took care of the outputs.

3. We met 5 days (5 times M-F) and texted everyday.

4. I helped with the state diagram for the RCU(required states and outputs) and the required configuration of flex counters to count/strobe on timer.

5.  Alex figured out that the shift_strobe is the enable to the Flex_9_Counter and figured out the RX_Data buffer was took care of the outputs. I learned from him also how to properly use the moore state diagram instead of the mealy diagram. (I got timer help from Tim(TA) also)

6. The testbench by "Andrew" on Piazza helped since it showed the different types of testcases that would be valid.
